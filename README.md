[![Clustering Visualization](outputs/pca_clusters.png)](outputs/pca_clusters.png)

## 🎯 Project Overview

I developed this comprehensive customer analytics platform that combines academic research with production-ready business intelligence solutions. Building on the foundation of "Exploration and Analysis of Amazon Customer Behavior" research, I created a system that delivers actionable customer segmentation and strategic business insights for e-commerce optimization.

### Research Foundation
- **Academic Paper**: Exploration and Analysis of Amazon Customer Behavior (Transilvania University of Brașov)
- **Research Focus**: I analyzed customer behavior patterns, satisfaction factors, and segmentation using machine learning
- **Dataset**: I worked with the Amazon Consumer Behaviour Survey (602 customers, 20+ behavioral attributes)

### Technical Implementation
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: I implemented advanced clustering with multiple algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative, GMM)
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: I applied PCA for optimal feature selection and visualization
- **Business Intelligence**: I built automated insights generation for marketing, operations, and strategic planning
- **Production-Ready**: I designed a scalable architecture with model persistence and automated reporting

## 📊 Key Findings & Results

### Optimal Customer Segmentation
- **Number of Clusters**: I identified 2 optimal clusters (validated by elbow method and silhouette analysis)
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Silhouette Score: 0.094
  - Davies-Bouldin Index: 2.91
  - Calinski-Harabasz Index: 69.49

### Customer Segments I Identified

| Cluster | Customers | Percentage | Profile | Key Characteristics |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Cluster 0** | 303 | 50.3% | **Beauty-Focused Shoppers** | Age 31.1, Beauty/Personal Care preference, Higher satisfaction scores |
| **Cluster 1** | 299 | 49.7% | **Diverse Category Shoppers** | Age 30.5, Multi-category purchasing, Higher purchase value ($70.7 vs $49.8) |

### Statistical Significance I Validated
- **Shopping Satisfaction**: p = 9.27e-86 (highly significant)
- **Customer Reviews Importance**: p = 1.51e-51 (highly significant)
- **Rating Accuracy**: p = 1.75e-51 (highly significant)
